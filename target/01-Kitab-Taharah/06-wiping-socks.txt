## Rulings on wiping over the _khuff_ (footgear/leather socks)

17. What's the ruling on wiping over the _khuffs_?

    It's permissible to wipe over them on seven conditions:

    1. They are worn after being in a state of complete purification
    2. They cover the area which is obligatory to wash during ablution
    3. It's possible to walk around in them (customarily)
    4. They are attached to the foot on their own
    5. They are permissible to use (not stolen, etc.)
    6. They are pure (in themselves)
    7. They do not describe the skin beneath due to being thin

18. What's the duration for (which) wiping over them (is permissible)? And what is the portion which is obligatory to wipe on?

    The resident or the one whose travel is sinful wipes for (a duration of) one day and one night, starting from the time ablution was invalidated after wearing the khuffs.[^fn-1]

    A traveller who shortens the prayer wipes for (a duration of) three days and three nights. The (travel) distance for which it permissible to shorten the prayers is: A travel of two moderate (in time) days on a beast (like camels, etc.) progressing at a steady pace.[^fn-2]

    It's obligatory to wipe the majority of the upper portion/top (of the _khuffs_), wiping the lower portion or the heel doesn't suffice, nor is it recommended.

19. What invalidates wiping over them?

    It is invalidated by one of the following three: 

    1. What necessitates _ghusl_.
    2. When the _Maḥal al-Farḍ_[^fn-3] ceases to be covered.
    3. The cessation of the allowed period for wiping.

20. Is wiping allowed on other than the _khuffayn_?

    Yes. It is permissible to wipe over a (cast/support made of wood or [FILLER] placed over a fracture or wound).

21. Inform me of the ruling over wiping over it.[^fn-4]

    If put on in a state of purity and does not exceed the wounded area, everything should be washed and the wounded area wiped over.

    (SENTENCE FILLER)

    If (the case) was put on when not in a state of purity, (FILLER).

[^fn-1]: Note: The time period for allowance of wiping over _khuffs_ starts when the state of purity in which they were put on is lost. For example, if you make _wuḍūʾ_ at 1pm and wiped over your _khuffs_. Then you lost your _wuḍūʾ_ at 6pm, it is allowed for you, as a resident, to wipe over your _khuffs_ until 6pm the following day.

[^fn-2]: It is approximately 80km.

[^fn-3]: _Maḥal al-Farḍ_: The two feet upto the ankles.

[^fn-4]: Note: (FILLER) in/from two situations/states:
First: It is placed in a state of purity. Here:  
1. It exceeds the required area; it should be (re)moved and reattached(FILLER Water something), if possible. If not, it is compulsory to perform _wuḍūʾ_ and _tayammum_.
2. If it doesn't exceed the wounded area, he would wash the healthy parts and wipe over the wounded area without performing _tayammum_.  
Second: It was put on when not in a state of purity. If possible, it should be removed and then put back on after performing _wuḍūʾ_. Otherwise, _wuḍūʾ_ and _tayammum_ should be performed, irrespective if the (splint) exceeds the wounded area or not.  
This is the (official position of the?) _madhhab_. Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymīyyah (May Allāh have mercy on him) opined that splints should be wiped over (unrestrictively?), irrespective if it was put on in a state of purity or not, and irrespective if it covers only the wounded area or not. _Tayammum_ is not required in any case. And this seems to be what is correct. And Allāh knows best. (See _Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā_ [21/179]).
