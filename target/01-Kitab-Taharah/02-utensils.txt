## Rulings of using utensils and parts of dead (animals) 

3. What utensils are permissible for acquisition?

     It is permissible to acquire any _ṭāhir_ utensils except those of gold and silver. Thus it's _ḥarām_ to use utensils of gold and silver.

4. What's the ruling on using utensils and clothes of Kuffār?

     The utensils and clothes of Kuffār are __ṭāhir__ as long as their impurity is not known.[^fn-1]

5. What is the ruling on parts of carrion?

    Bones and horns of carrion are _najis_. Its skin is also impure and doesn't become pure by tanning. However, it becomes permissible to use for dry things (as opposed to wet things) when tanned.[^fn-2]

    As for the hair, wool (fur), and feathers then it's pure if the animal is considered pure if alive, even if it's _ḥarām_ to eat, like cats.

[^fn-1]: If the impurity of the containers or clothes becomes known, they should be washed and then used.

[^fn-2]: For example: Using the skin as a container for (storing) wheat, barley, dirt, pebbles etc. As for using it as a vessel for keeping liquids in it then it's impermissible.

    The difference: the usage of the tanned skin for liquids might result in exceeding of the impurity unlike its usage for dry stuff.
