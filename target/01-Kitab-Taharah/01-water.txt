## Chapter of Water

Praises are for Allāh alone and Peace and Blessings be upon the last Prophet !pbuh.

1. What is purification linguistically and (Sharīʿah-wise)?

    Linguistically, purification means cleanliness. (Sharīʿah-wise), it means the lifting of (spiritual) impurity and removal of _khabath_. Spiritual impurities are of two kinds:

    i. _Akbar_: That which necessitates _Ghusl_.
    ii. _Aṣghar_: That which necessitates _Wuḍū_.

2. How many types of water are there? And what are they?

    There are three (3) types of water:

    i. First: _Ṭahūr_. Is is water that remains upon its initial original creation; whether it descends from the sky (i.e. rain) or sprouts from the ground. It is pure in itself and purifying for other than it. It can lift spiritual impurity and remove regular impurities.

    ii. Second: _Ṭāhir_. It is water:

        - Whose color, taste, or smell has changed due to mixing with a pure substance like Saffron.
        - That was _qalīl_ and used to lift ritual impurity.
        - That was dipped in by any hand of a sane _mukallaf_ Muslim who had awakened from sleep, before washing them three times with intent and saying _Bismillāh_. And this^[i.e. the washing of the hands of someone who wakes from sleep. However, it could also refer to the intention and saying of the _Basmalah_. Both possibilities are correct. See _Kashāf al-Qināʿ_ (vol. 1, pp. 33--34).] is _wājib_. And it^[i.e. _Ṭāhir_ water] is pure itself but not purifying.

        It is permissible to use for other than removing physical and ritual impurity such as in cooking and drinking and their likes.

    iii.  Third: _Najis_. It is _qalīl_ water in which _najāsah_ has fallen, even if it doesn't change one of its characteristics;[^fn-1] or _kathīr_ water where at least one of its characteristics change. It doesn't lift ritual impurity nor remove physical impurity. And _kathīr_ [^fn-2] is that which reaches _qullatayn_ or greater.[^fn-3] _Qullatayn_ is seventy-one (71) and three-sevenths (3/7) _riṭl_ in Nablus (Palestine) or whatever equals it.

[^fn-1]: Any water in which _najāsah_ falls into, is of two states:

    - The water is _qālil_.  That which is less than _qullatayn_ - (XXX) irrespective if it changes or not.
    - The water is _kathīr_. That which is greater than _qullatayn_ - it becomes _Najis_ if its color, taste, or smell changes.

[^fn-2]: Note: With regard to volume, water is divided into two categories:

    - _Kathīr_: That which is greater than _qullatayn_.
    - _Yasīr_ or _Qalīl_: That which is lesser than _qullatayn_.

[^fn-3]: _Qullatān_ (XXX). Its weight is approximately 200 kilograms. Its volume (FILLER).
