16. Q: Inform me of the all the characteristics of Wuḍūʾ.

    Its characteristics are:

    1. To intend the Wuḍūʾ for Ṣalāh.
    2. And then to say, “bismillāh.”
    3. Then to wash the hands thrice.
    4. And then to (XXX) and (XXX) thrice each.
    5. Then to wash the face thrice from the (...of the hair?) to (XXX) lengthwise and from ear to ear (widthwise?).
    6. Then to wash the hands until the elbows thrice.
    7. And then to wipe all of the apparent head ... (XXX XXX).
    8. (FILLER)[^fn3]
    9. Then to wash the feet upto the ankle thrice.

[^fn1]: It is reported in the _ḥadīth_ of Umars bin al-Khattab who said that the Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever makes _wuḍūʾ_ (XXX) and then says ‘I bear witness that there is no deity (worthy of worship) except Allāh and that Muḥammad is His servant and messenger,’ except that the eight doors of Jannah will open for him and he can enter from whichever he wishes.” Reported by Muslim (234), Abū Dāwūd (169), al-Tirmidhī (55) and there is an extension: “O Allāh, make me from the repentant and make me from the pure.” As for the extension “...and make me from your righteous slaves,” it has no basis. And Allāh knows best.

[^fn2]: Unfortunately, the author (May Allāh have mercy on him) mentioned in the beginning that there were eighteen (18) _sunan_ of _wuḍūʾ_ and then went on to mention nineteen _sunan_. It appears that he has followed the author of _Dalīl al-Ṭālib_ in the number of _sunan_. See _Manār al-Sabīl_ (1/34). He has added the recitation of Surah al-Qadr to the _sunan_ of _wuḍūʾ_. What a strange addition it is! Al-Sāmurī mentioned it in _al-Mustawʿib_ (1/169) and said, “Then recite Sūrah al-Qadr three times.” I could not find any evidence for it.

[^fn3]: (FILLER): (FILLER).
